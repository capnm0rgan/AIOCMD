AIOCMD is a basic toolkit program designed to simplify common windows repair commands like "sfc /scannow"
It can also automate the full suite of commands including resuming after recommended reboots.

This program requires no additional software or programs to run.
It has been tested on Windows 11 but should be backwards compatible with most windows operating systems.
